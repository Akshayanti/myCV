                \item Flagged historically noisy or high-FP detections by analyzing historical firing patterns and false positive rates, enabling faster researcher prioritization
                \item Reduced manual detection review workload by \(\sim \)80\%, while increasing true positive identification consistency across weekly triage cycles.
                \item \textbf{Technologies:} Python, GPT-4, MCP, Graph-based RAG, RAG, OpenAI, MS Azure
            \end{itemize}
